# Industrial Society and Its Smart Contracts

> An on-chain manifesto about technology, stored on the very technology it critiques. The irony is the point.

A minimal frontend for reading the Manifesto smart contract deployed on Base.

## Contract

| Network | Address |
|---------|---------|
| Base | 0xe18f428f5Fc9d23e3ec51fe1DB47201d5d4eaDEA |

## Stack

- Next.js 14
- Tailwind CSS
- viem

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Philosophy

The manifesto critiques technology while being stored immutably on a blockchain, read through a web application, and served via global CDN.

The contradiction is the art.
